Learning AI and ML
Creating a Readme as Git suggested, this repository is where I would add my code and learning notebooks and get familiar with Git, Python, Jupiter 

**First Notebook** is just to test the functionality of creating something in GIT, importing the repo to Azure Notebooks and then makeing changes to the notebook and publishing it 

5/26 **Object oriented Python** is documenting and learning the Object oriented Python concepts

5/28 :Started with the Linear Algebra course from MIT OCW. Also chanced upon the DAT 256 course from EDX. Which now led me to open up and enroll on two more courses in pluralsight
  - Understanding Pandas (Pawel Kordek)
  - Introiduction to Data visulaization with Python ( to understand Mathplotlib)
